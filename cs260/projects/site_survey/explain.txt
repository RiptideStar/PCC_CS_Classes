My extra.txt tests for exposures of over 100%. Of course, for these sectors to be put into the bad sectors list,
it is simple, just in the if statement that checks bad errorful data and puts in it into the bad sector list, just also include a check
to see if the exposure levels must be 100 or less. 
You won't see this change in process.cpp because I will leave it unchanged for you, but here is test data for exposure levels above 100. 
In the unchanged process.cpp, it should treat the values over 100 just like any other positive exposure level, but that's my ideas on testing
this very interesting condition!
